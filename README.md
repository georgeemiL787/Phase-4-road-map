# Phase 4 Roadmap

## With the Planning Team

- **Extracting the graph from CARLA** *(2 days)*  
- **Path smoothing and feasibility check** *(2-3 days)*  
  Ensuring the extracted graph is usable and optimal for TSP solutions.  
- **Waypoint generation & local planning** *(3 days)*  
  Refining the route for real-world constraints.  
- **Performance evaluation of TSP solutions** *(2-3 days)*  
  Testing different algorithms.  

## With the Perception Team

- **Traffic lights clustering** *(2 days)*  
- **Simulating complex urban scenarios** *(3 days)*  
  Testing perception models in high-traffic situations.  
- **Dynamic obstacle detection & tracking** *(4 days)*  
  Integrating perception with planning.  
- **Enhancing and optimizing our perception outputs** *(Ongoing)*  
  LIDAR only (pose estimation), camera.  

## General Additions

- **Unit testing & debugging** *(Ongoing)*  
  Ensuring each component works as expected.  
- **Simulation & real-time testing in CARLA** *(Ongoing)*  
  Running experiments with different conditions.  
- **Documentation & reporting** *(Ongoing)*  
  Keeping track of progress and findings.
